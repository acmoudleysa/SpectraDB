# **SpectraDB: A Lightweight Spectroscopic Data Manager**

## Overview
**SpectraDB** is a lightweight SQLite-based tool designed to manage and store high-dimensional spectroscopic data (2D fluorescence, FTIR, NMR, etc.) efficiently. The focus is on using relational and JSON-based storage techniques to avoid redundancy while keeping data easily accessible for analysis and visualization.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Storage**: Spectroscopic data (wavelength-intensity pairs) stored in a combination of relational tables and JSON, reducing redundancy and optimizing storage space.
- **Metadata Management**: Automatic de-duplication of metadata to prevent inserting duplicate samples.
- **Normalization**: Wavelength data is stored separately to avoid redundancy across experiments.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for small to medium datasets, with flexibility to scale or migrate to more advanced databases like PostgreSQL if needed.

## Project Ideas
1. **SQLite Schema Setup**:
   - Create relational tables for metadata (`sample_id`, `experiment_id`, `spec_id`).
   - Store wavelengths in a normalized table, with intensity data stored as JSON.

2. **Automated Metadata De-duplication**:
   - Implement logic to check for duplicate `experiment_id` and `spec_id` before inserting new data.

3. **Data Insertion and Retrieval**:
   - Develop functions to easily insert new spectroscopic data, including parsing and storing wavelength-intensity pairs.
   - Create efficient retrieval functions to load full spectroscopic datasets for analysis or visualization.

4. **Future Extensions**:
   - Add support for handling larger datasets by migrating to PostgreSQL or BigQuery if required.
   - Build a simple **dashboard** (using Dash or Streamlit) for querying, visualizing, and analyzing spectroscopic data.
   - Introduce basic **data cleaning** and **preprocessing** functionalities, such as baseline correction or noise filtering.
